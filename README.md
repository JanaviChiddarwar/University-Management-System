# University-Management-System

🏗️ Project Overview
o) The system is built to replace manual record-keeping with a digital, automated environment. 
o) It manages the complete lifecycle of both students and faculty, from initial registration to leave management and financial transactions.

🛠️ Tech Stack
👉 Language: Java (JDK 22 used)
👉 Frontend UI: Java Swing & AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)
👉 Backend Database: MySQL
👉 Connectivity: JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
👉 External Library: RS2XML (for seamless database-to-JTable data binding)

💡 Core Concepts Implemented
☑️ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Utilized Inheritance (Extending JFrame), Interface Implementation (ActionListener), and Encapsulation to build modular, reusable code.
☑️ Event-Driven Programming: Leveraged ActionEvent and ItemListener to create an interactive and responsive user experience.
☑️ CRUD Operations: Implemented Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities across all database entities (Students, Teachers, Fees, and Leaves).
☑️ Dynamic UI Layouts: Mastered Absolute Positioning (null layout) and coordinate-based component placement for precise UI control.
☑️ Relational Database Design: Engineered a normalized SQL schema to manage complex relationships between students, their courses, and fee structures.

🌟 Key Functionality
👉 Comprehensive Management: Dedicated modules for adding, updating, and searching faculty and student records.
👉 Fee Management System: A dynamic fee form that calculates total payable amounts based on selected courses and semesters, integrated with real-time database updates.
👉 Academic Tracking: Functionality to enter marks, view examination results, and manage subject allocations.
👉 Leave Portal: Digital leave application and tracking for both students and faculty.
👉 System Utilities: Integrated productivity tools including a custom Notepad and Calculator accessible directly within the app.

🎓 Learning Outcomes
☑️ Deepened understanding of Java Swing for desktop application development.
☑️ Gained proficiency in SQL database management and complex query execution.
☑️ Learned to bridge the gap between frontend UI and backend data using JDBC.
☑️ Developed problem-solving skills in UI/UX, specifically in handling dynamic data display and horizontal scrolling for large datasets.
