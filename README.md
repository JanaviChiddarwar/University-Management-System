# University-Management-System

🏗️ Project Overview
The system is built to replace manual record-keeping with a digital, automated environment. It manages the complete lifecycle of both students and faculty, from initial registration to leave management and financial transactions.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Java (JDK 22 used)
Frontend UI: Java Swing & AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)
Backend Database: MySQL
Connectivity: JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
External Library: RS2XML (for seamless database-to-JTable data binding)

💡 Core Concepts Implemented
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Utilized Inheritance (Extending JFrame), Interface Implementation (ActionListener), and Encapsulation to build modular, reusable code.
Event-Driven Programming: Leveraged ActionEvent and ItemListener to create an interactive and responsive user experience.
CRUD Operations: Implemented Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities across all database entities (Students, Teachers, Fees, and Leaves).
Dynamic UI Layouts: Mastered Absolute Positioning (null layout) and coordinate-based component placement for precise UI control.
Relational Database Design: Engineered a normalized SQL schema to manage complex relationships between students, their courses, and fee structures.

🌟 Key Functionality
Comprehensive Management: Dedicated modules for adding, updating, and searching faculty and student records.
Fee Management System: A dynamic fee form that calculates total payable amounts based on selected courses and semesters, integrated with real-time database updates.
Academic Tracking: Functionality to enter marks, view examination results, and manage subject allocations.
Leave Portal: Digital leave application and tracking for both students and faculty.
System Utilities: Integrated productivity tools including a custom Notepad and Calculator accessible directly within the app.

🎓 Learning Outcomes
Deepened understanding of Java Swing for desktop application development.
Gained proficiency in SQL database management and complex query execution.
Learned to bridge the gap between frontend UI and backend data using JDBC.
Developed problem-solving skills in UI/UX, specifically in handling dynamic data display and horizontal scrolling for large datasets.
